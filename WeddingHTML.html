    <p><i>Good evening, welcome to this most important moment in the lives of this couple.
We invite you to leave behind the worries and concerns of every day life and join us in the celebration of their marriage.
This is an opportunity for us to share not only in the joy of Kayla and Kyle’s love but also to reaffirm and appreciate the love and the friendship we experience in our own lives.
May we all celebrate by being fully present during our short time together.
Kayla and Kyle have chosen this setting in which to be married because it provides an appropriate backdrop for the public affirmation of their love.
Kayla and Kyle view marriage as a coming together at all levels of being – mind, body, and spirit.
A marital commitment includes the willingness to be open and vulnerable, and the courage to take risks.
Marriage is a conscious act of will.
To remain in marriage we must continually renew our will to be married.
Marital partners accept the challenges that living together in love offer.
They decide that they will face the fears that are a necessary part of establishing and nurturing an intimate relationship.
And you, Kayla and Kyle have made the commitment to create and recreate this conscious partnership.
Those of us who are married or in relationships may take this moment to consciously reaffirm our commitment to our partners and ourselves.
Marriage consists of entrusting our deepest selves into the loving care of another.
It is a public and legal act to be sure.
It is also an emotional and spiritual act.
The spiritual aspect of marriage must be embraced openly, seriously, and completely for the marriage to endure.
Kayla and Kyle commit themselves today to each other in sacred trust.
They promise to embrace conflict as well as peace; to work as well as play; to struggle as well as coast; to give as well as receive; and to be with, stay with, and move toward one another.</i>
